## Tokens

Design tokens are the fundamental building blocks of a design system, serving as a single source of truth for design decisions to ensure consistency across platforms and speed up workflows. Their main purposes are to capture design attributes like colors, spacing, and typography, make them reusable, and allow for system-wide updates, which improves collaboration and maintains brand consistency.

**Centralize design decisions**: Tokens are the single source of truth for all visual attributes, replacing "magic numbers" and ensuring that all design values are defined and tracked in one place.

**Ensure consistency**: By using the same tokens across all elements, interfaces, and platforms, you prevent visual inconsistencies and ensure a cohesive user experience.

**Enable scalability**: Design tokens make it possible to build a scalable and reusable system that can be used across different platforms (web, mobile, etc.) and devices.

**Facilitate efficient workflows**: Tokens automate repetitive tasks, reduce errors, and streamline the handoff between designers and developers by providing a shared language.

**Maintain themes and contexts**: You can use tokens to systematically apply different design contexts, like a high-contrast theme or a light/dark mode, by redefining the tokens for that specific theme.

**Reduce technical debt**: Instead of hardcoding design values into the codebase, which creates technical debt, tokens centralize the decisions. This makes it easier and safer to update the entire application with a single change.

**Streamline updates and evolution**: When a design needs a global change, such as updating a color palette, you can change the token once, and the update will propagate automatically and consistently across the entire product.

**Promote collaboration**: Tokens help designers and engineers "speak the same language" by abstracting design decisions into a technology-agnostic format that is easy for both disciplines to understand and use.
